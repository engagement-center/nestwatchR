## Development Tasks :construction:

This repository is in early development with plans to add additional
functions to create an R package to facilitate accessibility.

üî≤ Internal testing

## Overview :pushpin:

[NestWatch](http://www.nestwatch.org) is a participatory science project
operated by the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](bird.cornell.edu). Since
1965, members of the public have been following a standardized protocol
for observing and reporting the nests of birds in the United States and
Canada (and more recently, globally). This data set contains raw nest
records submitted to NestWatch, including millions of nest check
observations from hundreds of thousands of nest attempts (\>750,000 in
2025). The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of
functions to aid in accessing and analyzing the wealth of nesting data
contained in the NestWatch database.

**The metadata paper associated with this dataset [(Bailey et
al.¬†2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4230) is critical for
understanding and interpreting data fields and their contents**. This
dataset is scheduled for updates annually on or about January 31.
Relevant details can also be found on the [NestWatch website
here](https://nestwatch.org/explore/nestwatch-open-dataset-downloads/).
<br> <br>

## Installation :computer:

This package is under active development and is likely to have bugs and
unexpected issues. Presently, the package exists off-CRAN in the public
[`engagement-center/nestwatchR`](https://github.com/engagement-center/nestwatchR)
GitHub repository. To install the package on your local machine, run the
following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# Install nestwatchR package in R
remotes::install_github("engagement-center/nestwatchR")
```

This package primarily uses the `R` programming language, and some
knowledge of R is necessary for using these products. A function in this
collection also depends on the program `Python`, which needs to be
[installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine prior to
using the function. No prior knowledge of Python or manual setup of the
program is needed. To check if Python 3.3 or later is installed on your
machine run the following code chunk:

``` r
install_status <- nzchar(Sys.which("python"))

if (isTRUE(install_status)) {
  venv_status <- system("python -m venv --help", intern = TRUE, ignore.stderr = TRUE)
  if (length(venv_status) > 0) {
    print("Python is installed and supported.")
  } else {
    print("Python is either not installed or the version is not supported. Please go to <https://www.python.org/downloads/> to install the latest version of Python and then restart your R session.")}
} else {
  print("Python is not installed. Please go to <https://www.python.org/downloads/> to install Python.")}

rm(install_status)
```

<br> <br>

## Data access :globe_with_meridians:

Data from NestWatch are free to access either from the
[`nw.getdata()`](https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.getdata.html)
function in R or as a direct download from the [Mendeley Data
Archive](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wjf794z7gc/2) or NestWatch
website. NestWatch Open Dataset by Cornell Lab of Ornithology is
licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0. We encourage researchers seeking to conduct
formal analyses to use these data. As with any dataset, knowing the data
structure, understanding the metadata, grasping the data collection
protocols, and being aware of the unique aspects of the program are all
critical for conducting analyses and interpreting results in ways that
provide meaningful insights. Prior to analysis, we encourage all users
of NestWatch Data to read the article [‚ÄúDownload Raw NestWatch Data for
Analysis‚Äù](https://nestwatch.org/explore/nestwatch-open-dataset-downloads/)
article on our website.

<br> <br>

## Versions :memo:

This package is on Version 0.0 and will be updated to maintain
functionality and improve accessibility to the NestWatch datasets. If
you encounter issues while using the package, you can submit an
[issue](https://github.com/engagement-center/nestwatchR/issues) on
GitHub or [contact us
directly](mailto:kim.savides@cornell.edu?subject=nestwatchR%Issue%%3A).

The NestWatch Open Dataset is updated annually, by or around 31 January,
with the previous year‚Äôs nesting records. NestWatch also updates the
database with historical nest records being archived from other
projects. To improve reproducibility in NestWatch analyses, each version
of the dataset is archived in Mendeley, and each specific version can be
downloaded either using the
[`nw.getdata(version = )`](https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.getdata.html)
function or by a direct download from the [Mendeley
archive](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wjf794z7gc/2).

## Quick Start :ledger:

This quick start guide shows how to download data and plot the first lay
dates of two species from the NestWatch Open Dataset: Carolina and
Bewick‚Äôs wrens. Note that here we force the download of Version 1 of the
NestWatch dataset for reproducibility. When running your own analyses,
you will likely want to download the latest version of the NestWatch
data (see
[`nw.getdata()`](https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.getdata.html)
for more information).

``` r
# Load NestWatch Package
library(nestwatchR)
library(dplyr)

# Download NestWatch dataset by version
nw.getdata(version = 1)
# nw.getdata()  # no argument will default to downloading the latest version 

# Merge the Attempts and Checks files
nw.mergedata(attempts = NW.attempts, checks = NW.checks, output = "merged.data")
nrow(merged.data)
#>  [1] 2639824

# Filter the dataset to include just Carolina and Bewick's wrens
wrens <- merged.data %>% filter(Species.Code %in% c("carwre", "bewwre"))
nrow(wrens)
#>  [1] 40290
glimpse(wrens)

<img src="man/figures/README-plot-1.png" alt="A histogram displaying the distrubution of first lay dates for Bewick's Wren (blue) and Carolina Wren (green)." width="100%" />

Here we plot two histograms to inspect the distribution of First Lay
Dates between Bewick‚Äôs and Carolina Wrens. Note that the NestWatch
dataset continues to grow with each breeding season, so the numbers
shown in the examples on this site will likely be different from what
you see using the most current version of the Open Dataset.
