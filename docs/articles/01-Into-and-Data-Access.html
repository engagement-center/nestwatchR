</h2>
<p>Our ability to allocate conservation efforts of the natural world
depends on detailed information about the life histories, distributions,
abundances, and population trends of species over time. The goal of the
<a href="https://nestwatch.org" class="external-link">NestWatch project</a>, administered by
<a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/" class="external-link">The Cornell Lab of
Ornithology</a>, is to use data collected by members of the global
participatory science community and researchers to archive nest location
and phenology information for the world’s bird populations. NestWatch is
designed to track status and trends in the reproductive biology of
birds, including when nesting occurs, number of eggs laid, how many eggs
hatch, and how many hatchlings survive. Our database is intended to be
used to study the current condition of breeding bird populations and how
they may be changing over time as a result of climate change, habitat
degradation and loss, expansion of urban areas, and the introduction of
non-native plants and animals.</p>
<p>This vignette gives an overview of the NestWatch Data Products, which
represent both nest-level parameters and individual nest checks.
Knowledge of the structure of the database is critical for proper
interpretation of the dataset. This example will discuss some of the 54
data fields, but we ask all users of the data to review the field
explanations in the data paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4230" class="external-link">Bailey et al. 2024</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="access">Data Access<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#access"></a>
</h2>
<p>The NestWatch database is freely accessible via a <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wjf794z7gc" class="external-link">Mendeley data
repository</a>, the <a href="https://nestwatch.org/explore/nestwatch-open-dataset-downloads/" class="external-link">NestWatch
website</a>, or the <code><a href="../reference/nw.getdata.html">nestwatchR::nw.getdata()</a></code> function and
is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1" class="external-link">CC
BY-NC 4.0</a>. Users are free to access and modify the data for
non-commercial use with proper citation. By downloading the data, the
user agrees to have read the below terms of use prior to use.</p>

<h3 id="dowload-nestwatch-data">Dowload NestWatch Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dowload-nestwatch-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are two data products available for download via the function
<code><a href="../reference/nw.getdata.html">nestwatchR::nw.getdata()</a></code>. The only argument,
<code>version =</code>, to this function defines the version of the
database to be downloaded and if not provided will default to the latest
version. This function will download, unzip, and import two dataframes
to the global environment. Depending on your connection speed, this may
take a few minutes.</p>

<p>This function creates an virtual instance of Python within R to
access the Mendeley data archive. Once run, two dataframes will be
available in the global environment: <code>NW.attempts</code> and
<code>NW.checks</code>. These dataframes are not saved to your
machine–you may wish to use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/write.table.html" class="external-link">write.csv()</a></code> to access again
without the need to re-download the dataset.</p>

<p><code>NW.attemps</code> contains nest-level parameters. These fields

predator guards, etc as well as summary data for the nest attempt such
as success/failure, clutch size, first lay date, fledge date, etc.</p>

binary; Response to “Was the nest site visited during the egg laying
period?” (1 = yes, 0 = no). This variable was originally intended to
gauge the quality of the first egg date estimate during a time period
when nest check data was not being collected (e.g., The Birdhouse
Network). It was retained later for continuity even after nest checks
were enabled because some participants may choose not to enter all of
their nest checks. See Cooper 2014 for further detail.</li>

<li>
<strong>Visit Datetime:</strong> participant provided; datetime; The
date and time that individual nests were visited. Time is stored for
some entry modes but not all. Time may be to nearest hour for older
data, or to the second for mobile-entered data. Time is stored in the
user’s local time zone (but time zone itself is not stored). See Visit
Time Valid to determine if the time was stored during data entry.</li>

Condition of nest during each nest visit. One of: no (no nest), an
(another bird nest, same site), cn (complete nest), dn (damaged nest),
fn (flattened nest with fecal matter), in (incomplete nest), nn
(non-avian nest), rn (nest removed, remover unknown).</li>
<li>
<strong>Adult Activity:</strong> participant provided; categorical;
Adult activity seen or heard near the nest during each nest visit. This
can help determine if a nest was still active, particularly if the
contents could not be seen directly. categorical One of: no (no adults
seen or heard), aa (at/on, then flushed from nest), ba (building nest or
carrying nest material), da (dead adult(s)), fa (feeding young at nest),
ra (remained on the nest), va (vicinity of the nest).</li>
<li>
<strong>Young Status:</strong> participant provided; categorical;
Developmental stage of young during each nest visit. One of: no (no live
young in nest), fy (fully feathered young), hy (hatching young), ny
(naked young), py (partially feathered young), vy (vocal young, heard
only), yy (young outside of box).</li>
<li>
<strong>Management Status:</strong> participant provided;
categorical; Management action taken by the nest monitor. One of: no (no
management activity), am (avian competitor nest/eggs/young removed), bm
(banded adults or young at nest), em (unhatched host eggs removed), nm
(nest box management), pm (pest management [e.g., wasps, ants, mice,
etc.]).</li>
<li>
<strong>Host Eggs Count:</strong> participant provided; integer;
Number of host eggs counted during a nest check. May be null if user did
not provide information or was not able to count precisely. See also
Host Eggs Present Uncounted.</li>
<li>
<strong>Host Eggs Present Uncounted:</strong> participant provided;
binary; The user may indicate that host eggs were present but the exact
count is unknown. In this case, Host Eggs Present Uncounted will be set
to 1. Nest checks where Host Eggs Count &gt; 0 or Host Eggs Present
Uncounted = 1 may both be considered to have host eggs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Live Host Young Count:</strong> participant provided;
integer; Number of live host young counted during a nest check. May be
null if user did not provide information or was not able to count
precisely. See also Live Host Young Present Uncounted.</li>
<li>
<strong>Live Host Young Present Uncounted:</strong> participant
provided; binary; The user may indicate that live host young were
present but the exact count is unknown. In this case, Live Host Young
Present Uncounted will be set to 1. Nest checks where Live Host Young
Count &gt; 0 or Live Host Young Present Uncounted = 1 may both be
considered to have live host young.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dead Host Young Count:</strong> participant provided;
integer; Number of dead host young counted during a nest check. May be
null if user did not provide information or was not able to count
precisely. See also Dead Host Young Present Uncounted.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dead Host Young Present Uncounted:</strong> participant
provided; binary; The user may indicate that dead host young were
present but the exact count is unknown. In this case, Dead Host Young
Present Uncounted will be set to 1. Nest checks where Dead Host Young
Count &gt; 0 or Dead Host Young Present Uncounted = 1 may both be

<p>Some analyses may only require use of data contained in
<code>NW.attempts</code>. However, we suggest users merge the two
dataframes on their shared <code>Attempt.ID</code> to have all the
available data on-hand. Some of the suggested data cleaning processes
require use of data in both dataframes, and having a single merged
dataset more easily facilitates these cleanings. The two dataframes can
be merged using <code><a href="../reference/nw.mergedata.html">nestwatchR::nw.mergedata()</a></code>. This function
has three arguments: <code>attempts =</code> and <code>checks =</code>
are used to define the appropriate dataframe and the optional
<code>output =</code> can be used to specify the name of the resulting
merged dataframe.</p>
