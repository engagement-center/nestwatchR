<p>This data cleaning vignette will cover several different methods for
cleaning data found within the <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wjf794z7gc/2" class="external-link">NestWatch Open
Dataset</a>. NestWatch data are collected by volunteer participants
(researchers and the public) and are known to contain some common errors
and inconsistencies. Thus, these data should be considered as “raw”, and
the analyst should consider their individual study system and research
objectives when deciding what cleaning procedures to conduct. This
package contains two functions to provide coarse-scale cleaning
procedures that NestWatch staff have identified in order to help
analysts prepare NestWatch data for analysis. Please read the full
function documentation and this vignette prior to cleaning the data.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="background">Background<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background"></a>
</h2>
<p>NestWatch data entered in real-time from the U.S. and Canada are
passed through a series of filters that attempt to catch data-entry
errors or prevent unlikely responses in clutch size, number of young,
timing of nesting, incubation periods, and brooding periods. This
real-time feedback system does not identify all potential errors. For
instance, if a participant enters the number of eggs incorrectly but the
typo in clutch size is still biologically possible, no feedback will be
given. Even if real-time feedback is given, the participant may override
the warning if they feel the entry they have made is accurate.
Participants do occasionally observe unusually large clutch sizes or
nests that have occurred well outside of the traditional nesting period
for the focal species. It is up to each analyst to decide if these
observations are relevant. Importantly, these initial biological filters
have not been established for species nesting outside of the U.S. and
Canada or for species that are seldom reported.</p>
<p>NestWatch additionally implements a geographic review of species
location based on filters curated by <a href="https://ebird.org/home" class="external-link">eBird</a>. For example, a participant
should not be able to report a nest from a species that is extremely
rare at the locale, preventing many species identification errors. Note
that for similar sympatric species, incorrect identifications are not
flagged by this process (e.g., a Black-capped Chickadee may be
misidentified as a Carolina Chickadee in regions of range overlap).
However, older reports, including historic data migrated to the
NestWatch database, are not subjected to the same review process. We
recommend that data analysts map nest locations and screen for likely
location errors. See the <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.filterspatial.html"><code>nw.filterspatial()</code></a>
and <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/articles/c_Data-Filtering.html">Filtering
Vignette</a> for more information on spatial filtering.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-consolidating-taxonomic-units">Filtering &amp; consolidating taxonomic units<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#filtering-consolidating-taxonomic-units"></a>
</h2>
<p>The NestWatch platform uses <a href="https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data/the-ebird-taxonomy" class="external-link">eBird
taxonomy</a> to standardize species’ names. This allows participants to
select any available eBird taxonomic unit, including “spuhs” (i.e.,
“chickadee sp.”), slashes (i.e., “Tree/Violet-green Swallow”), hybrids
(i.e., “Mallard x American Black Duck (hybrid)”), and subspecies/forms
(i.e., “Downy Woodpecker (eastern)”). The function <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.cleantaxa.html"><code>nw.cleantaxa()</code></a>
helps filter out and/or “roll up” these taxonomic units. This function
uses a NestWatch dataframe as <code>data =</code> and has logical
arguments <code>spuh =</code>, <code>slash =</code>,
<code>hybrid =</code>, and <code>rollsubspecies =</code> where
<code>T</code> removes attempts with those spuh, slash, or hybrid
designations and subspecies/forms are “rolled up” to the species level
(i.e., “Downy Woodpecker (eastern)” → “Downy Woodpecker”). If arguments
are set to <code>F</code> or <code>NULL</code> the filtering and/or roll
up are not performed. The resulting dataframe may be optionally named
with <code>output =</code>. This function changes both the common names
and the species codes to reflect the changes made to the taxonomic
unit.</p>
<p>Taxonomy updates to the participant interface and internal database
are implemented concurrently with updates from <a href="https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/reference/get_ebird_taxonomy.html" class="external-link"><code>auk::get_ebird_taxonomy()</code></a>.
However, new versions of the NestWatch Open Dataset are published in
January and may be taxonomically outdated for short periods of time
(this typically affects a limited number of records). Previous versions
of the NestWatch Open Dataset are not updated for taxonomic or other
corrections; we encourage the use of the most recent version. For more
information, see <a href="https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/reference/ebird_taxonomy.html" class="external-link"><code>auk::ebird_taxonomy</code></a>
and <a href="https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data/the-ebird-taxonomy" class="external-link">eBird
Taxonomy</a>.</p>

</h4>
<p>Correct usage of a “spuh” would, for example, be if a participant
observed a chickadee nesting in a region of Black-capped/Carolina
Chickadee range overlap and was unable to confirm the exact species with
certainty. The same would be true if a participant monitored a nest box
of a swallow species and never saw the adults at a site where both Tree
and Violet-green Swallows were present. In both cases, either a slash or
spuh could be appropriate.</p>
<p>When reasonable certainty of a specie(s) identity is needed, the
analyst may decide to omit spuhs and slashes:</p>

<h4 id="subspeciesforms-hybrids">Subspecies/forms &amp; Hybrids<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#subspeciesforms-hybrids"></a>
</h4>
<p>Some subspecies or forms are easily differentiated and may be
reported as such by a participant. Caution should be taken when using
these subspecies/form designations because the identification skills of
participants are unknown and the participant may not have selected the
correct designation from the pre-populated list of possible species.
Consider whether or not there may be biologically relevant differences
in nesting behavior, phenology, or other parameters between different
subspecies/forms before analyzing data at that level. If these potential
differences are not biologically relevant to the analysis, the analyst
may opt to <code>rollsubspecies = T</code> to combine subspecies and/or
forms to the species level.</p>
<p>Nesting attempts involving parents of different species, a hybrid
parent, or two hybrid parents, are very uncommon. The NestWatch database
has no way to easily differentiate between these three cases. Thus, if a
hybrid species code was entered for a nest attempt, the species identity
of the parents is uncertain. Additionally, participants may incorrectly
select a hybrid species when they should have selected a spuh or slash
species designation. If you are interested in validating attempts
labeled with hybrid status, you may <a href="https://data.nestwatch.org/nw/contact" class="external-link">request additional
information</a> from NestWatch staff asking for the “notes” fields which
may contain additional information not exported in the public
dataset.</p>

<p>The function <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.cleandata.html"><code>nw.cleandata()</code></a>
is a collection of 11 common cleaning procedures which NestWatch staff
have identified to assist analysts in cleaning NestWatch data. You will
need to specify which procedures to run, lettered <code>a:k</code> (not
case sensitive), and we highly suggest you read the function
documentation and the following examples before selecting which
procedures to run. After these coarse scale cleaning procedures are
completed, the user should continue reviewing the data at a finer scale
including considering spatial and phenological filtering. See the <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/articles/c_Data-Filtering.html">Filtering
Vignette</a> and <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.filterspatial.html"><code>nw.filterspatial()</code></a>
and <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.filterphenology.html"><code>nw.filterphenology()</code></a>
functions.</p>
<p>The function <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.cleandata.html"><code>nw.cleandata()</code></a>
takes a NestWatch dataframe as <code>data =</code> and allows you to
specify the function’s <code>mode =</code> as either <code>"flag"</code>
or <code>"remove"</code>. When mode is set to flag, nest attempts which
do not meet the cleaning criteria will be noted in a new column
<code>Flagged.Attempt</code> with the value <code>FLAGGED</code> or
<code>NA</code>. If mode is set to remove, these flagged attempts are
removed from the output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ If you are only interested in a subset of species, or RAM usage
and processing time are a concern, you may choose to subset the data to
your focal species prior to running <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.cleandata.html"><code>nw.cleandata()</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="cleaning-procedure-definitions">Cleaning Procedure Definitions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cleaning-procedure-definitions"></a>
</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>
<strong>Obligate Brood Parasites:</strong> Flag/remove attempts with
<code>Species.Name</code> entered as species know to be obligate brood
parasites. Species like Brown-headed Cowbirds are obligate brood
parasites and do not create their own nests. This is not the correct
interpretation of the nest species. Users may choose to look at these
data more closely if investigating brood parasitism. To view a list of
identified obligate brood parasites, <a href="#parasite-table">click
here</a>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>No Nesting Activity:</strong> Flag/remove attempts with
Outcome of “no breeding behavior observed” (u3), “inactive” (i), and
“not monitored” (n). These data likely represent nests or nest boxes
where eggs were not laid, or nests that were not monitored. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Invasive Species Management:</strong> Flag/remove attempts
with Outcome of “invasive species management” (f5). For these attempts,
the participant chose to remove/alter eggs or nests of invasive species.
If the user is interested in analyzing participants’ habits in invasive
species management or using some of the data fields (e.g., clutch size,
first lay date), they might consider skipping this method with the
understanding that the outcome code is interpreted as “failure due to
human interference” and standard nest survival estimates would not be
meaningful. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Failed but fledged?:</strong> Flag/remove attempts if
outcome is a failure code (f, f1, f2, f3, f6, f7) but recorded fledged
host young &gt; 0. In this case, a participant may have either
characterized the nest’s outcome incorrectly, recorded the presence of
fledged host young incorrectly, or mischaracterized brood parasite young
as host young. If an attempt produces any number of fledged host young,
the attempt is considered successful.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Successful but didn’t fledge?:</strong> Flag/remove attempt
if Outcome is success (s1), but recorded fledged host young = 0. Inverse
of d.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>More young than eggs?:</strong> Flag/remove attempt if #
hatched host young &gt; clutch size. This may indicate incorrectly
entered data or long lengths of time between nest checks where summary
data was not properly updated. You may choose to review these attempts
by looking with caution at the nest visit data to validate hatched young
and clutch sizes.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>More fledged young than hatched young:</strong> Flag/remove
attempt if # fledged host young &gt; # hatched host young. Similar to
f.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Unmapped Region Code:</strong> Flag/remove attempts for
which NestWatch failed to identify a region (Subnational.Code == “XX-”).
Subnational.Code is automatically assigned based on coordinates supplied
by the participant. Many attempts identified as XX- likely resulted from
nests being located in water bodies and/or participants entering
incorrect coordinates. Consider removing the “XX” attempts if the
coordinates are implausible for the focal species and consider inclusion
if analyzing coastal or water-nesting species (e.g., Osprey nesting on
channel markers).<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Decrease-then-increase Eggs/Young:</strong> Flag/remove
attempts where the number of eggs or young decrease and then
subsequently increases. This may happen if a nest fails and a new
attempt is started at the same location, which should be two individual
nesting attempts. If the analyst is looking at host response to
depredation events or egg dumping you may choose to retain these
records. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Impossibly long attempts:</strong> Flag attempts with
implausible nesting periods. Incorrect years are sometimes entered
between date summary fields by participants. This may produce impossibly
long nesting periods. To account for nesting phenologies in all
hemispheres, this procedure identifies attempts in which (1) Fledge Date
- First Lay Date &gt; 365 days, (2) Hatch Date - First Lay Date &gt; 84
days, or (3) Fledge Date - Hatch Date &gt; 300 days. These dates
represent the maximum nest phenological period for any bird species and
are not realistic for the majority of the NestWatch dataset. We
encourage users to determine reasonable phenologies for their species of
interest and use <a href="https://engagement-center.github.io/nestwatchR/reference/nw.filterphenology.html"><code>nw.filterphenology()</code></a>
to run a finer filter on nest phenology dates. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Year errors in visits:</strong> Flag/remove attempts where
the # days between the first and the last visit are &gt; 365 days.
Additional check to identify nest attempts where year portion of dates
between nest visits were likely incorrectly entered. A user may choose
to review these attempts individually to identify typos.<br><br>
</li>

<p>Depending on what cleaning procedures you choose to run, the sample
size of nests will decrease to varying degrees. If your species has a
small sample size after using <code>mode = "remove"</code> you may
consider rerunning with <code>mode = "flag"</code> and inspecting which
attempts were removed and if each cleaning method was appropriate for
your analysis. Particularly for cleaning steps <code>d:g</code>, you may
prefer to nullify questionable fields without deleting the entire
attempt (e.g.,if your analysis only requires location, species, and
first lay date, then you may not need to remove attempts with
questionable outcome codes).</p>
