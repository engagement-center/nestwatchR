<p>This vignette will cover several different methods for cleaning data
found within the NestWatch Open Dataset. NestWatch data are collected by
volunteer participants (researchers and the public) and are known to
contain some common errors and inconsistencies. Thus, these data should
be considered as “raw”, and the user should consider their individual
study system and research objectives when deciding what cleaning
procedures to conduct. This package contains two functions to provide
coarse-scale cleaning procedures that NestWatch staff have identified in
order to help the user clean NestWatch data for analysis. Please read
the full function documentation and this vignette prior to cleaning the
data.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="background">Background<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background"></a>
</h2>
<p>NestWatch data entered in real-time from the U.S. and Canada are
passed through a series of filters that attempt to catch data-entry
errors or prevent unlikely responses in clutch size, number of young,
timing of nesting, incubation periods, and brooding periods. This
real-time feedback system does not identify all potential errors. For
instance, if a participant enters the number of eggs incorrectly but the
typo in clutch size is still biologically possible, no feedback will be
given. Even if real-time feedback is given, the participant may override
the warning if they feel the entry they have made is accurate.
Participants do occasionally observe unusually large clutch sizes, or
nests that have occurred well outside of the traditional nesting period
for the focal species. It is up to each analyst to decide if these
observations are relevant. Importantly, these initial biological filters
have not been established for species nesting outside of the U.S. and
Canada or for species that are seldom reported.</p>
<p>NestWatch additionally implements geographic filters on real-time
entered species, which are curated by eBird. In other words, a
participant should not be able to report a nest from a species that is
extremely rare in that region; thus, many species misidentifications are
prevented. However, for similar sympatric species, incorrect
identifications are still possible (e.g., a Black-capped Chickadee may
be misidentified as a Carolina Chickadee in regions of range overlap).
However, older reports, including historic data migrated to the
NestWatch database, not subjected to the same rigorous filters.
Additionally, errors in reporting can mimic errors in identification.
Participants may intend to report one species but enter their
information for the wrong species. We recommend that data analysts map
nest locations and screen for likely errors. See the
<code><a href="../reference/nw.filterspatial.html">nw.filterspatial()</a></code> and Filtering vignettes for more
information on spatial filtering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="clean-taxa">Clean Taxa<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clean-taxa"></a>
</h2>
<p>The NestWatch platform uses <a href="https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data/the-ebird-taxonomy" class="external-link">eBird
taxonomy</a> to standardize species’ names. This allows participants to
select any available eBird taxonomic unit, including “spuhs” (i.e.,
“chickadee sp.”), slashes (i.e., “Tree/Violet-green Swallow”), hybrids
(i.e., “Mallard x American Black Duck (hybrid)”), and subspecies/forms
(i.e., “House Wren (northern)”). The function <code>nw.cleantaxa</code>
helps filter out and/or “roll up” these taxonomic units. This function
uses a NestWatch dataframe as <code>data =</code> and has logical
arguments <code>spuh =</code>, <code>slash =</code>,
<code>hybrid =</code>, and <code>rollsubspecies =</code> where
<code>T</code> removes attempts with those designations and
subspecies/forms are “rolled up” to the species level (i.e., “House Wren
(northern)” → “House Wren”). If arguments are set to <code>F</code> or
<code>NULL</code> the filtering and/or roll up are not performed. The
resulting dataframe may be optionally named with <code>output =</code>.
This function changes both the common name and the species code to
reflect the changes made to the taxonomic unit.</p>
<p>Taxonomy updates to the participant interface and internal database
are implemented concurrently with updates from
<code><a href="https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/reference/ebird_taxonomy.html" class="external-link">auk::ebird_taxonomy</a></code>. However, new versions of the NestWatch
Open Dataset are published in January and may be taxonomically outdated
for short periods of time (this typically affects a very low number of
records). Previous versions of the NestWatch Open Dataset are not
updated for taxonomic or other corrections; we encourage the use of the
most recent version. For more information, see <a href="https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/reference/ebird_taxonomy.html" class="external-link"><code>auk::ebird_taxonomy</code></a>

</h4>
<p>Correct usage of a spuh would, for example, be if a participant
observed a chickadee nesting in a region of Black-capped/Carolina
Chickadee range overlap and was unable to confirm the exact species with
certainty. The same would be true if a participant monitored a nest box
of a swallow species and never saw the adults at a site where both Tree
and Violet-green Swallows were present. In both cases, either a slash or
spuh could be appropriate.</p>
<p>When certainty of a specie(s) is needed, the analyst may decide to
omit spuhs and slashes as species is not known with certainty:</p>

<h4 id="subspeciesforms-hybrids">Subspecies/forms &amp; Hybrids<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#subspeciesforms-hybrids"></a>
</h4>
<p>Some subspecies or forms are easily differentiated and may be
specified by a participant. Caution should be taken when using these
subspecies/form designations as the identification skills of the
participant are unknown and the participant may not have selected the
correct designation from the pre-populated list of possible species.
Consider whether or not there may be biologically relevant differences
in nesting behavior, phenology, or other parameters between different
subspecies/forms before cleaning or analyzing these data. If these
potential differences are not biologically relevant to the analysis, the
analyst may opt to <code>rollsubspecies = T</code> to combine subspecies
and/or forms to the species level.</p>
<p>Documentation of nesting attempts between different parent species, a
hybrid parent, or two hybrid parents are very uncommon. The NestWatch
database has no way to easily differentiate between these three cases.
Thus, if a hybrid species was selected for an attempt, the parent
specie(s) of the nest vs the resulting young specie will not be known
with certainty. Additionally, participants may incorrectly select a
hybrid species when they should have selected a spuh or slash species
designation. If you are interested in validating attempts labeled with
hybrid status, you may <a href="https://data.nestwatch.org/nw/contact" class="external-link">request additional
information</a> NestWatch staff from “notes” fields which may contain
additional information not exported in the public dataset.</p>

</h2>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/nw.cleandata.html">nw.cleandata()</a></code> is a collection of 10 common
cleaning procedures which NestWatch staff have identified to assist
users in cleaning NestWatch data at a coarse scale. You will need to
specify which procedures to run, lettered <code>a:j</code>, and should
read the function documentation and the following examples while
considering your analyses before selecting which procedures to run.
After these coarse scale cleanings are completed, the user should
continue cleaning the data at a finer scale including considering
spatial and phenological filtering. See the filtering vignette and
<code><a href="../reference/nw.filterspatial.html">nw.filterspatial()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/nw.filterphenology.html">nw.filterphenology()</a></code>
functions.</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/nw.cleandata.html">nw.cleandata()</a></code> takes a NestWatch dataframe
as <code>data =</code> and allows you to specify the function’s
<code>mode =</code> as either <code>"flag"</code> or
<code>"remove"</code>. When mode is set to flag, nest attempts which do
not meet the cleaning criteria will be noted in a new column
<code>Flagged.Attempt</code> with the value <code>FLAGGED</code> or
<code>NA</code>. If mode is set to remove, these flagged attempts are
removed from the output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>![NOTE] If you are only interested in a subset of species, or RAM
usage and processing time are a concern, you may choose to subset the
data to those species prior to running <code>nw.cleandata</code>.</p>

</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>
<strong>Brown-headed Cowbirds:</strong> Flag/remove attempts with
<code>Species.Name</code> as “Brown-headed Cowbird” as they are nest
parasites and do not create their own nests. This is not the correct
interpretation of the nest species. Users may choose to look at these
data more closely if investigating brood parasitism. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>No Nesting Activity:</strong> Flag/remove attempts with
Outcome of “no breeding behavior observed” (u3), “inactive” (i), and
“not monitored” (n). These data likely represent nests or nest boxes
which never received eggs or were unmonitored. Users may choose to
include these data if looking at habitat or location data without
measures of phenology or success. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Invasive Species Management:</strong> Flag/remove attempts
with Outcome of “invasive species management” (f5). For these attempts,
the participant chose to remove/alter eggs or nests of invasive species.
If the user is interested in analyzing participants’ habits in invasive
species management or using some of the data fields (e.g., clutch size,
first lay date), they might consider skipping this method with the
understanding that the outcome code is interpreted as “failure due to
human interference” and standard nest survival estimates would not be
meaningful. Note: “Invasive species management” may also be incorrectly
chosen by participants trying to indicate nest failure caused by an
invasive species, in which case it would still be prudent to flag or
remove such records. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Failed but fledged?:</strong> Flag/remove attempts if
outcome is a failure code (f, f1, f2, f3, f6, f7) but recorded fledged
host young &gt; 0. In this case, a participant may have either
characterized the nest’s outcome incorrectly, recorded the presence of
fledged host young incorrectly, or mischaracterized brood parasite young
as host. Discerning the true outcome may not be possible or expedient.
If an attempt produces any number of fledged host young, the attempt is
considered successful.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Successful but didn’t fledge?:</strong> Flag/remove attempt
if Outcome is success (s1), but recorded fledged host young = 0. Inverse
of d.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>More young than eggs?:</strong> Flag/remove attempt if #
hatched host young &gt; clutch size. This may indicate incorrectly
entered data or long lengths of time between nest checks where summary
data was not properly updated. You may choose to review these attempts
by looking with caution at the nest visit data to validate hatched young
and clutch sizes.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>More fledged young than hatched young:</strong> Flag/remove
attempt if # fledged host young &gt; # hatched host young. Similar to
f.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Unmapped Region Code:</strong> Flag/remove attempts for
which NestWatch failed to identify a region (Subnational.Code == “XX-”).
Subnational.Code is automatically assigned based on coordinates supplied
by the participant. Many attempts identified as XX- likely resulted from
nests being located in water bodies and/or participants entering
incorrect coordinates. Consider removing the “XX” attempts if the
coordinates are implausible for the focal species and consider inclusion
if analyzing coastal or water-nesting species (e.g., Osprey nesting on
channel markers).<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Impossibly long attempts:</strong> Flag attempts with
impossible nesting periods. Incorrect years are sometimes entered
between date summary fields by participants. This may produce impossibly
long nesting periods. To account for nesting phenologies in all
hemispheres, this procedure identifies attempts in which (1) Fledge Date
- First Lay Date &gt; 365 days, (2) Hatch Date - First Lay Date &gt; 84
days, or (3) Fledge Date - Hatch Date &gt; 300 days. These dates
represent the maximum nest phenological period for any bird species and
are not realistic for the majority of the NestWatch dataset. We
encourage users to determine reasonable phenologies for their species of
interest and use <code><a href="../reference/nw.filterphenology.html">nw.filterphenology()</a></code> to run a finer filter
on nest phenology dates.<br><br>

<strong>Year errors in visits:</strong> Flag/remove attempts where
the # days between the first and the last visit are &gt; 365 days.
Additional check to identify nest attempts where year portion of dates
between nest visits were likely incorrectly entered. A user may choose
to review these attempts individually to verify if a typo occurred.<br><br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on what cleaning procedures you choose to run, the sample
size of nests may decrease to varying degrees. If your species has a
small sample size after using <code>mode = "remove"</code> you may
consider rerunning with <code>mode = "flag"</code> and inspecting which
attempts were removed and if each cleaning method was appropriate for
your analysis. Particularly for cleaning steps <code>d:g</code>, you may
prefer to nullify questionable fields without deleting the entire
attempt (e.g.,if your analysis only requires location, species, and
first lay date, then you may not need to remove attempts with
questionable outcome codes).</p>
